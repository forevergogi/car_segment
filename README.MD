## A car segment task implemented based on the DeepLab v3 plus

## Introduction
The segment approach is based on the DeepLab v3 plus method, the original code implemented
by pytorch can be found [here](https://github.com/hualin95/Deeplab-v3plus).And the dataset used in this
project is from the Kaggle Carvana Image Masking Challenge, the link is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/data).

## Requirements
Python(3.6) and Pytorch(0.4.1) is necessary before running the scripts.
To install the required python packages(expect PyTorch), run
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
